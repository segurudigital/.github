# Seguru Digital

**Digital strategy, WordPress performance, and infrastructure for mission-driven organizations.**

Seguru Digital was co-founded by **Samuel Clarke** and **Cameron Gilroy**, starting as a multi-stack WordPress agency and evolving into a full digital strategy and advisory partner for organizations that want to own their data and build on resilient, open technologies. We work across the USA and Australia with clients in healthcare, legal, defense, churches and non-profits, overland and outdoor industries, and real estate.

## How We Work

We believe in:
- **You Own Your Data**  
  No lock-ins. No black-box platforms.
- **Open Web First**  
  Open standards, transparent tooling, and long-term autonomy.
- **Plan for the Worst**  
  Security, backups, compliance, and infrastructure designed for resilience.
- **Against Deplatforming**  
  We help clients build independent digital foundations that cannot be taken away.

We don’t try to be the hero. Our clients are the hero of their own story. We act as the guide who strengthens the foundations so they can focus on their purpose.

## Who We Serve

We specialize in mission-driven small and mid-sized organizations, including:
- Clinics, wellness centers, and alternative health providers  
- Attorneys and law firms
- Churches and non-profits

## Our Approach

We start with hosting and infrastructure as the anchor. We then layer on strategy, design, integrations, and AI enablement in a way that fits each organization’s internal capacity and long-term goals.

We prefer transparency, clear pricing, and long-term relationships built on trust. We offer referral options that reward partners with lifetime percentages for hosting and up-front commissions for project work.

- stable and secure hosting  
- websites that actually work  
- strategy that cuts through noise  
- support that feels human  
- technology that empowers rather than complicates

When the digital foundation is solid, mission-driven leaders are free to do what they do best.
